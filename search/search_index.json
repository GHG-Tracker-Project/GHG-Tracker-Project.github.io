It is built on Postgres for robust, scalable storage and uses alembic to manage schema migrations. Database models are defined using SQLModel, a Python library that combines the power of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic. This approach ensures that the database schema remains programmatically accessible to new developers.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"database/#development","title":"Development","text":"<p>Checkout the repository if you want to contribute to the database design and/or data ingestion:</p> <p>GitHub Repo</p>"},{"location":"python-client/","title":"Python client documentation","text":"<p>This client provides a high-level way of retrieving data and is the recommended way to access LEDGER data.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The client is still under active development and currently only available from GitHub.
