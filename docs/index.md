# GHG Tracker Project Documentation

Here you will find all the documentation for the GHG Tracker Project.
The project consists the LEDGER database which houses all the data, a FastAPI to query the database, and client program for high-level access.
We currently only use Python for the client, but are open to building client applications in other languages if there is enough demand.

This is a work in progress
